# Syncosaurus

Syncosaurus is a performant, collaborative, real-time Javascript framework that enables developers to focus on their application's features and business logic instead of the complexities of state synchronization and conflict resolution.

- The ability to automatically persist state on a per-[room](https://syncosaurus.github.io/docs/category/core-concepts/rooms) basis
- A convenient [CLI tool](https://github.com/syncosaurus/syncosaurus-cli) to seamlessly create, configure, manage, and deploy your collaborative application
- An [analytics dashboard](https://github.com/syncosaurus/syncosaurus-dashboard) to monitor your collaborative application's usage and error metrics
- Authentication support to secure your rooms
